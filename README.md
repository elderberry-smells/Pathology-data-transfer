# Pathology-data-transfer
small bit of code used to convert ratings in a row-wise format to a column format.  Update the 2 initial fields for the file you want to convert, and the file you want to update with the converted ratings (the projectbook).  Intial files have to be in csv format, and the project book column 'Rating' has to be deleted.
